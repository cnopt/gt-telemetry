# gt-telemetry
###### Original proj forked from AleBles
An application that pulls data from Gran Turismo 7 and displays it in realtime using a React based frontend. Server backend uses SocketIO to emit events to the frontend every time the GT7 listener socket receives a packet from the PS4.
<br/>

The frontend is using components from my [gt7-react-components](https://github.com/cnopt/gt7-react-components) project also available on GitHub.


### Todo
- [x] Push data to browser instead of console
- [x] Convert original TS scaffold to JS
- [x] Handle Server events with Node exclusively
- [x] Integrate React client with server
- [x] Get React components imports working
- [ ] Style client with gt-7 comps
